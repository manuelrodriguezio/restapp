Sample app implementing a REST API with Java Play.

# Purpose

This application shows how to implement a very basic REST API using Java Paly. The API is used to manage a single type of objects: Person. An instance of a Person keeps track of the following bits of information:

- Id – a number that uniquely identifies a Person object instance within your app. This number is most frequently auto generated by your persistence server, whether it is a SQL-based database,  a NoSQL alternative, or your own backend server.
- firstName – a string representing the first name of the Person.
- lastName – a string representing the last name of the Person.
- age – an integer representing the age of the Person.

Our REST API is going to enable us to : a) create new instances of Person, b) get the data for a Person instance, c) update the information for a Person instance, and d) delete a Person instance. All these operations exchange Person object instances between client and server components as Java Script Object Notation (JSON) strings.  Operations b, c, and d will use the personId as the attribute to find the right Person instance.
